To host a simple static website (HTML, CSS, JS) for free using GitHub Pages.

1. Created GitHub Repository

    Named the repository: `<yourusername>.github.io` (this naming format is required for GitHub Pages).

2. Cloned the Repository Locally

    Used Git CLI or GitHub Desktop to copy the repository to the local system.

3. Added Website Files

    Copied all static website files (HTML, CSS, JS) into the local repository folder.

4. Committed and Pushed Files to GitHub

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial website upload"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. Enabled GitHub Pages

   * Navigated to Repository Settings â†’ Pages.
   * Set the source branch to `main` and folder to `/ (root)`.

6. Accessed the Live Website

    Waited a few minutes and visited:
     `https://<yourusername>.github.io`

7. Understood Deployment Workflow

    Learned how to update the site by committing and pushing new code.
